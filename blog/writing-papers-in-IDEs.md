examples where IDE is superior to a text editor for writing papers:
- refactoring that checks for dangerous deletions/renames
- sophisticated find&replace functions, incl. regex
- syntax & error highlighting
- integrated git support:
    - git blame reminds you who, and when wrote/edited a specific line or number 
    - diffs show what changed between versions
    - easy to switch between different versions of a paper or revert to previous versions
